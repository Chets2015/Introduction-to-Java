java I/O Streams
In this tutorial, we will learn about Java input/output streams and their types.

In Java, streams are the sequence of data that are read from the source and written to the destination.

An input stream is used to read data from the source. And, an output stream is used to write data to the destination.

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
For example, in our first Hello World example, we have used System.out to print a string. Here, the System.out is a type of output stream.

Similarly, there are input streams to take input.

Input stream reads data from source to program and output stream writes file from program to destination

We will learn about input streams and output streams in detail in the later tutorials.

Types of Streams
Depending upon the data a stream holds, it can be classified into:

Byte Stream
Character Stream
Byte Stream

Byte stream is used to read and write a single byte (8 bits) of data.

All byte stream classes are derived from base abstract classes called InputStream and OutputStream.

Character Stream
Character stream is used to read and write a single character of data.

All the character stream classes are derived from base abstract classes Reader and Writer.
